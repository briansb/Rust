Welcome to Rust!

This will download and install the official compiler for the Rust
programming language, and its package manager, Cargo.

It will add the cargo, rustc, rustup and other commands to
Cargo's bin directory, located at:

  C:\Users\user\.cargo\bin

This can be modified with the CARGO_HOME environment variable.

Rustup metadata and toolchains will be installed into the Rustup
home directory, located at:

  C:\Users\user\.rustup

This can be modified with the RUSTUP_HOME environment variable.

This path will then be added to your PATH environment variable by
modifying the HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Environment/PATH registry key.

You can uninstall at any time with rustup self uninstall and
these changes will be reverted.

Current installation options:


   default host triple: x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
     default toolchain: stable
               profile: default
  modify PATH variable: yes

1) Proceed with installation (default)
2) Customize installation
3) Cancel installation
>1

info: profile set to 'default'
info: default host triple is x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
info: updating existing rustup installation


Rust is installed now. Great!

To get started you need Cargo's bin directory (%USERPROFILE%.cargo\bin) in your
PATH
environment variable. Future applications will automatically have the
correct environment, but you may need to restart your current shell.

Press the Enter key to continue.
